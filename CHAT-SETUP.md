## Tidio Chat Widget Integration

The chat widget has been integrated into the BaseLayout and is ready for activation. Follow these steps to complete the setup:

### 1. Get Your Tidio Account
1. Sign up at [tidio.com](https://tidio.com)
2. Create a new project for "Chasers DD"
3. Navigate to Settings > Developer in your Tidio dashboard
4. Copy your Public Key

### 2. Update the Integration
Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` in `/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` line 179:
```html
<script src="//code.tidio.co/YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY.js" async></script>
```

### 3. Customize Chat Settings in Tidio Dashboard

### 4. Custom Styling Applied

- Your contact form on /contact

### 6. Alternative: Intercom Setup

If you prefer Intercom instead of Tidio:

1. Replace the Tidio script with:
```html
<script>
  window.intercomSettings = {
    api_base: "https://widget.intercom.io",
    app_id: "YOUR_INTERCOM_APP_ID",
    custom_launcher_selector: '.intercom-launcher'
  };
</script>
<script>(function(){var w=window;var ic=w.Intercom;if(typeof ic==="function"){ic('reattach_activator');ic('update',w.intercomSettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments);};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args);};w.Intercom=i;var l=function(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://widget.intercom.io/widget/YOUR_INTERCOM_APP_ID';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);};if(document.readyState==='complete'){l();}else if(w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})();</script>
```

2. Update the CSS selectors from `.tidio-` to `.intercom-`
